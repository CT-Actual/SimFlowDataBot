**Priority Adjustments**:
1. **Rear ARB Arm**: Decrease by 1 position (P3→P2, P4→P3, etc.)
2. **Nose Weight**: Decrease by 0.2-0.5%
3. **RR Tire Pressure**: Increase by 2-3 psi
4. **Front Splitter**: Decrease by 1 position (less downforce)
5. **Rear Shocks**: Soften compression and rebound by 1-2 clicks

**Secondary Adjustments**:
- Decrease rear differential preload
- Decrease rear spring rates
- Increase rear spoiler (more rear downforce)

### 🟡 LOOSE EXIT (Oversteer on Corner Exit)
**Symptoms**: Car spins wheels, rear slides when accelerating out of corners
**Priority Adjustments**:
1. **Cross Weight (Wedge)**: Increase by 0.2-0.5%
2. **Rear Differential Preload**: Increase by 5-10 ft-lbs
3. **Rear Spoiler**: Decrease by 1 position (less drag)
4. **Rear Spring Rates**: Increase by 50-100 lbs/in
5. **Fuel Load**: Check if low fuel is affecting balance

**Secondary Adjustments**:
- Increase rear differential coast setting
- Adjust brake bias more forward
- Increase rear tire pressures slightly

### 🟢 TIGHT EXIT (Understeer on Corner Exit)
**Symptoms**: Car pushes when accelerating, can't get power down effectively
**Priority Adjustments**:
1. **Cross Weight (Wedge)**: Decrease by 0.2-0.5%
2. **Rear Differential Preload**: Decrease by 5-10 ft-lbs
3. **Rear Spoiler**: Increase by 1 position (more downforce)
4. **Rear Spring Rates**: Decrease by 50-100 lbs/in
5. **Brake Bias**: Move rearward by 1-2%

**Secondary Adjustments**:
- Decrease rear differential coast setting
- Decrease rear tire pressures slightly
- Adjust camber for better contact patch

## Track-Specific Setup Guidelines

### 🏁 Superspeedway (2.5+ miles - Daytona, Talladega)
**Focus**: Aerodynamics and drafting efficiency
**Key Adjustments**:
- **Rear Spoiler**: Higher positions (3-4) for stability
- **Front Splitter**: Lower positions (1-2) for less drag
- **Tire Pressures**: Higher pressures for reduced rolling resistance
- **Nose Weight**: Around 50-51% for stability

### 🏁 Intermediate (1.5-2.0 miles - Charlotte, Atlanta, Las Vegas)
**Focus**: Balance between downforce and mechanical grip
**Key Adjustments**:
- **Rear ARB Arm**: Primary handling adjustment (P2-P4)
- **Nose Weight**: 49.5-51.5% depending on track characteristics
- **Tire Pressures**: Balance between grip and tire wear
- **Spring Rates**: Moderate rates for compliance and control

### 🏁 Short Track (Under 1.0 mile - Bristol, Martinsville)
**Focus**: Mechanical grip and handling balance
**Key Adjustments**:
- **Rear ARB Arm**: Most critical for handling balance
- **Cross Weight**: Fine-tune for turn-in and exit
- **Brake Bias**: Critical for wheel-to-wheel racing
- **Shock Settings**: Important for body control

## Optimization Workflow

### 1. Practice Session Priority
1. **Rear ARB Arm** - Find basic balance
2. **Nose Weight** - Refine front/rear balance
3. **Tire Pressures** - Optimize grip and wear
4. **Shock Settings** - Fine-tune body control

### 2. Qualifying Priority
1. **Rear Spoiler** - Maximize speed
2. **Front Splitter** - Balance aerodynamics
3. **Tire Pressures** - Optimize for single lap
4. **Fuel Load** - Minimal fuel for qualifying

### 3. Race Priority
1. **Nose Weight** - Long-term balance
2. **Rear ARB Arm** - Consistent handling
3. **Tire Pressures** - Manage tire wear
4. **Fuel Load** - Strategy consideration

## Critical Telemetry Channels

### Must Monitor
- **Tire Pressures**: All four corners
- **Nose Weight Percent**: Front/rear balance
- **Cross Weight Percent**: Wedge adjustment
- **Track Position**: Consistency indicator
- **Lap Time**: Performance metric

### Important for Analysis
- **Tire Temperatures**: All four corners
- **Shock Velocities**: Suspension movement
- **Spring Rates**: Confirm settings
- **Brake Temperatures**: Brake balance validation

## Setup Change Guidelines

### Making Changes
1. **One change at a time** - Isolate effects
2. **Test systematically** - Consistent laps
3. **Record everything** - Track all adjustments
4. **Communicate clearly** - Note handling changes

### Change Magnitudes
- **Tire Pressure**: 2-3 psi increments
- **Nose Weight**: 0.2-0.5% increments
- **ARB Arms**: 1 position at a time
- **Spring Rates**: 50-100 lbs/in increments
- **Shock Settings**: 1-2 clicks at a time
